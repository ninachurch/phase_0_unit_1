## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I initially tried to set it up through the terminal, and it was quite confusing since I didn't really know when it had actually understood/processed what I said. I found it challenging to navigate through so many windows to try to set things up. I think from here on out it will be helpful to read all the way through the unit instructions before diving in and figure out exactly where to start.

* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 

Imagine coming to the close of your huge take home midterm that's due the next day. You've been working for hours on it, put stress and tons of coffee into getting it done. Then, just as you're about to put on the final touches, your computer crashes. When you anxiously restart you realize that the file is gone. 

This incredibly frustrating instance led to startups like Dropbox and Box, who allow you to save your work to the Cloud so you won't have to risk losing it quite as much. Much like these applications solved a big problem that allows you to save and access your files safely, Git is a version control system that's solving some of the biggest problems with saving and sharing code. Git takes snapshots of your work as you modify files and keeps them in a repository. This is huge, as it allows multiple programmers to work on different parts of the code without accidentally deleting or affecting the code of their coworkers/teammates/fellow programmers.
 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

Version Control is the process of tracking changes being made to a file. It prevents you from accidentally deleting or destroying a file. GitHub is a form of version control that works by taking snapshots of the code and saving them, allowing programmers to socially, collaboratively and safely work on their code.

* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

As someone who has definitely experienced loss of stuff I've worked hard on, I can only imagine how important this is in terms of safely storing code. Mainly I love the idea though because of the open source concept; I think it's so cool to be able to collaborate and build on each others' work. 

* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I'm still unclear what exactly is happening in the terminal if I'm doing commands directly there versus in the app. Also unsure whether I should try to adjust things in the browser or on my local app. However the process  of modifying/staging/committing and  idea of git/git hub seems clear.

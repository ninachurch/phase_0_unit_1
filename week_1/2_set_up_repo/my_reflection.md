## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

First, make sure you have a GitHub account and have downloaded the GitHub app on your computer (if you don't plan on 'talking straight to your computer' through the terminal that's on there- if you don't know what the terminal is, then don't worry about this and just use the app :)
On the browser on your account click the little '+' button and add a repository. Make sure you're the woner, then give the repository a name. You can choose to make it public or private, and decide what type of copyright license you want to give it. Click the green, "create repository" button and celebrate the birth of your first repository! woohooo

* Describe what open source means

Open Source is the process of sharing how a program was made and giving for permission for it to be customized. In other words, people can use existing open source code to build their own versions of that software or add to already exisitng projects.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

As technology becomes more and more common in every industry, I think Open Source is hugely important. Not only does it make programming more accessible but it saves so much time which leads to more progress.

* Assess the importance of using licenses

Since I was young the importance of bibliogrophies and citations have been drilled into me regarding every assignment I've ever submitted. I think honoring the original creator/contributors of any work is hugely important in any domain, and it's cool to see that these exist with programs as well.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?



* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

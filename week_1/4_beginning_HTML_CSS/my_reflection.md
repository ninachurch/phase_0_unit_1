## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 

The process of building the site was pretty straight forward. It all seems to make sense.

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

The simplicity is definitely a pro- it seems very easily accessible and learnable. On the downside the code looks a lot less organized than others I've seen and it is limited. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

It was just so exciting and gratifying to learn something and immediately see it live!

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

"Don't Fear the Internet" is an amazing guide to basic HTML & CSS for Non-Web developers made by two amazing designers. It's pretty helpful.

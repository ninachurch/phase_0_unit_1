## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  

I ran into a lot of little issues that ended up taking up a lot of time. I realized as I built out the first few features that they were taking a lot of time because I hadn't learned one of the basic tools associated with it like the box model. This made me more conscious of thinking through what I need to do at the beginning and working from there.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  

I figured floating out, but still can't seem to format it so that the "subContent" and "imageWithCaption" classes float next to each other 100% of the time. As of now, they float when you stretch the screen but do not adjust if the screen is too small. I played around a lot with the widths and looked through all the online material I could find but can't seem to figure out why.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

It took me a while to figure out how to center elements because I wasn't adding the width in- once I learned that it was very cool to see things centered! This also really helped me solidify my understanding of divs/ids/classes, and they went from being confusing to incredibly helpful.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge?

I'd say I'm 85% confident. I understand the logic/rhetoric behind HTML and CSS very well now, but there are still a couple weird happenings in practice that I'm unclear on (like the one listed above) but I think could be cleared up talking to others fairly quickly.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I enjoyed seeing what I had learned in the last experiments put into action, and being able to build on them. I also enjoyed having a little more freedom to play with the design. I also really liked that I could jump around: I'd start out to do one thing then would find another way to improve the site and try it out. It was super easy to continue building on things.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

It was hard when I was spending upwards of half hour trying to do something as small as center the text or make both floated elements fit in one window. I had to constantly remind myself that even though it was a small task, I'm brand new to HTML/CSS and this is all good. It gave me a good opportunity to pick up new things as I went through the different resources trying to find the answer.

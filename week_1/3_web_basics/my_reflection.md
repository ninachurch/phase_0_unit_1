## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

1) That the World Wide Web is built on top of the Internet. I had heard before that there was a difference between the two, but never really learned what it was. 
2) That HTML and CSS are not programming languages. I didn't realize they were just syntaxes.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

-Compose the site of compelling "elements" or paragraphs/headings/images/lists/tables
-Mark the begining and end of each element with an opening and closing tag
-An opening tag is composed of the tag name in brackets, and the closing character goes bracket-forward slash- tag name - close bracket
-Container Elements "contain" other elements or content, while stand alone elements can't contain anything else
-Values must be contained inside quotes
-The doctype or markup language being used is displayed at the top of the page - and is case sensitive
-The entire page content must be contained between tags using the bracket formation that have html as the tag name -- this comes after the doctype
-Head tags have the page title and info = particularly important for SEO --> not everything is visible to the user
-Body tags contain actual site content --> all visible to the user
-Don't forget to close out the head and boy tags the same way you would any other tag, using 'head' or 'body' as the tag name
-Don't forget to nest!

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

It was exciting! It was nice to be able to learn about something I had almost no idea about before and then actually do something on my own. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I found this all super helpful, since I often feel like the Internet/Web just magically do what we ask and have very little idea of all the time and work that goes into everything. The three things that most impacted me werelearning the differences between the Internet and the Web, then between a website and a Web App, and then how DNS works. These gave me a much deeper understanding of general web functionality.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

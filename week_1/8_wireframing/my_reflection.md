## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I've had the great pleasure of studying at the Stanford design school for two years now, so I like to think that I have a decent knowledge of UX and design thinking. However it was nice to challenge myself to look at things with a technical eye rather than just an aestetic one. For example when I noticed that 8tracks, a site I use almost daily, has a uniquely placed navigation bar I realized the thought that must have gone into it.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I love design and UX, althoguht I did think the wireframe wasn't all that enriching of an activity because it seemed to be very straightforward and not quite necessary to do all three of the sites.

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  

I've used various wireframe tools before on other projects, so this time I decided to challenge myself to do it by hand on pen and paper. It was much faster and I liked it because I could easily play with notes and margins and change things up without getting to stuck in one place.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  

I'm still a little unclear what the best way on paper would be to mockup a multi-page site.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

Use pen and paper before moving to an online tool!

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 

Very confident.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

Getting to read about design thinking/UX (in particuarly in life/experience design) since it's what I've been studying in school

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Having to wireframe all three sites- I think I just have similar taste in sites so all three had fairly similar designs which just made it seem a bit boring.

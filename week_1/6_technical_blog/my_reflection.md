## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url:  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I definitely enjoyed the writing part- though building the template took a lot of time and I was a bit disappointed that the design didn't turn out as epic as I'd imagined it. In particular I struggled with making the border go all the way around the body, but did discover a cool trick to make a fixed header. It was also fun content wise to go back and evaluate the sites I've been to repeatedly with a new eye.

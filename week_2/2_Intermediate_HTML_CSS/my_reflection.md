# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	
	Web standards are great because they are a generally agreed upon way for browsers to display things, and in turn for users to view things and programmers to make things. Without it it would be incredibly challenging to build web pages and as a user, very confusing when switching browsers.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	
	From a logical stanpoint, the Documnet Outlining/standard structure makes total sense. If you're trying to display information, it is very helpful to showcase conent in a cascading way. However I'm not quite sure if this is what standard structure means? If it's the box model system, then it makes total sense that every element is a subset of the page that can be individually filled with content, styled, and set to respond to different conditions.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

	They're awesome! The semantic nature of HTML5 makes it straightforward to read other people and your own code which is helpful in so many ways when it comes to editing and makes it possible to use things like Chrome Dev Tools. It also allows you to be more efficient with your code. 

* Why is reset.css necessary?
	
	Browsers don't all default display files the same way. To combat this, you can zero out an element's margins and padding but it still won't necessarily apply across browsers because not all elements (mainly form elements) will take to this. The reset.css file explicitly lists all html5 elements and specifies their padding rather than just putting things into a universal selector. 

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

	I used Safari for a while and my programming friends laughed at me and told me to get onto Chrome. I didn't really see why they even cared, but now I can understand why people would prefer one browser over another.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

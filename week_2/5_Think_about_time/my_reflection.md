# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

	Definitely splitting the work up during the weekdays. The last two weeks I've been in school/working during the day and I only end up doing the work the last couple nights before it's due/my extension is submitted. This prevents me from participating in the required interactive elements and is very unhealthy as it leads to a whole week of sleeplessness and feeling behind.

* How will you combat that? 

	I'm going to start applying the "Get Things Done Method" to make sure I'm focusing on getting one element done at a time. I'm also going to schedule out my days for the next two weeks until school is out to make sure I'm properly maximizing my time.

* What techniques will you try?
	
	I'm going to try some "tricks for getting in the zone" to help me get into my work faster. I'm also going to try meditating for 15 minutes a day (not ending up napping!) 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

	Power through the next two weeks of school/my job by very carefully managing and maximizing my time. However I will not compromise learning the basics, so for these next two weeks I will over communicate with the DBC team and take extensions, ensuring that I gain a strong foundation. When my finals are finished, I'll spend ~3-4 hours each day working on Phase 0 prep, this way it does not end up all crammed into 1-2 days/nights before the deadline.

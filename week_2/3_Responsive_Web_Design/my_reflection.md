# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

	Responsive design is the action of making website/page displays readable on devices with various screen sizes. It's awesome given today's frequent use of phones, tablets and other devices as mediums to browse the web. If we didn't have it, it would be not only an inconvienience from an aestetic standpoint but also a challenge as information could get cutoff or be unreadable.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	
	Responsive design likely wouldn't be around in the capacity it is without the development of smartphones or tablets, since the changes from browser to browser wouldn't warrent all the time needed for responsive design. I think a faster and better framework for making pages responsive is yet to be fully developed, but I'm sure people are working on it. In the future, I think new technologies will similarly prompt us to come up with not so glamorous ways to make our current systems work with the new one.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

	Design is not about look, it's about experience. Oftentimes on the web the visual element dictates the majority of the experience, but it certainly not the sole element. In my opinion, making your site fulfill its goal while also making it a well designed experience for someone who is visually impaired is the ultimate test of whether you're a good designer.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

	I'm shocked that there's not a better, faster way to make web pages more responsive. I can see now why people talk about how awesome bootstrap and wordpress are, because while HTML and CSS are awesome and fun, they seem to take a lot of time for something that doesn't turn out all that great without outside pieces.

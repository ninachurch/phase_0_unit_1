# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: https://github.com/ninachurch/ninachurch.github.io/blob/master/index.html
Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

From the design perspective, I want to get all the information across. But on the user side, a lot of words and things on the page feel overloaded. I learned that it's hard to find the balance, and that's important to keep in mind when wireframing.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

It was fun working on the plan, though I had to learn to be ok not sticking with my initial wireframe and moving on to different things. I really enjoyed it but it was so time consuming that it was a struggle.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I made my own index using the tools we learned, but wanted to push myself to learn some new commands to make it more interesting. I decided to explore some free, online html5 templates and try to emulate my favorite elements. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I really like the sides that scroll down and make it look like you're moving through multiple pages- I'd like to figure out how to do that. 

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

I'm definitely excited to eventually use bootstrap- I think it will do super cool things. The material as it stands was pretty good, although I definitely still need some practice on responsive design formatting. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
